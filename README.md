# 5calls-ts-react-redux
This repo is a proof-of-concept showing how the 5 Calls website could be developed
using the React UI framework, the Redux state management library
and TypeScript for type-safe JavaScript development.

The code here is not intended to replicate the design of 5 Calls and all of
its functionality; it is just a technology demonstration.
